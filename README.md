> # OCR_Card_Details
> Implemented a proof of concept (POC) to instantly capture essential details from KYC documents (Driving License, Voter ID, Passport) and store them in a relational database. Utilized OpenCV for grayscaling and noise reduction in images and Pytesseract to extract embedded text. This solution streamlines the process of extracting and storing critical information from KYC documents efficiently.

> This POC was submitted to the startup Dhiyo.io, which is developing an API specifically for extracting details from KYC documents.
